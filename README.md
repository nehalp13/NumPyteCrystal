# The Search for the NumPyte Crystal

You've reached it, the cave of the NumPyte Crystal! After many grueling weeks of training, packing, and climbing, you've arrived at the mouth of Array Cave in the mountains of Datalore - and it's exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Better, even! But now the journey has only just begun, as the reason you're here - the same reason as everyone else who makes the journey to the cave's entrance - is to solve the Mystery of Matrix Grotto and acquire the NumPyte crystal deep within the caverns of the mountain. Be sure that you're prepared - you'll need the toolkit the masters built for you to aid you in this mission. You also have your [guidebook](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners#), a common resource for all adventurers to this particular cave. With these two resources at your disposal, this adventure should be an absolute breeze.
