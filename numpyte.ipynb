With a simple command, you can interleave the two vials into a single flask. You can use [`.dstack()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dstack.html) and one of the methods you've used [above](#Task-3:-Adjusting-the-Vial-Shape) to stack the arrays depth-wise into a shape of (8, 4)."

At the center of the vast cavern lies an overgrown temple, obviously left to ruin millennia ago. You climb down to the ruin and peak through the door. Inside, the pops and drips are muffled by the stone walls but you look through the torn rafters above and can see the stalactites on the ceiling, shimmering with Sourcewater and reflecting the orange of the Firejelly below. You step into the quiet room of the temple, and spot an oddly colored rectangle on a stone dais. It... seemed like a sponge, like one you would use for cleaning your sink. You feel a pull towards the dais from the flask at your hip. \n",
